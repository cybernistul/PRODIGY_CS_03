Hello, I am Nistul Premod 

This is my first internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. I have created a simple Password Complexity Checker for users to input and check the strength of their passwords, offering visual feedback based on password strength criteria. It aims to enhance password security by evaluating length and repeating patterns within the password.

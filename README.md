Hello, I am Nistul Premod 

This is my first internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. I have created a simple Password Complexity Checker for users to input and check the strength of their passwords, offering visual feedback based on password strength criteria. It aims to enhance password security by evaluating length and repeating patterns within the password.

### Project: PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER

### Objective
The objective of the project is to build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength

### Key Activities
- **Assess strength of your password with color coded meter**:

ðŸ”´ Weak = Red color
ðŸŸ¤ Moderate = Brown color
ðŸŸ£ Strong = Purple color
ðŸŸ¢ Very strong = Green color
- Displays reasons when the given password is not strong enough 
- Toggle your password visibility when typing and checking
- Alerts users to change the password when the password has commonly used passwords worldwide as it is easy to crack
- Alerts user when essential criterias of a strong password such as combination of letters, numbers and symbols are not used.
- Warns users if their password contains repeated characters in sequence.
- This programme doesnot require an Internet Connection 


### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Tkinter**: A built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- **PicturesBase64**: A module presumably containing base64 encoded images used in the application
